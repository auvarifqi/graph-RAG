At the ominous\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'\n\n'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in\noperation?'\n\n'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were\nnot.'\n\n'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.\n\n'Both very busy, sir.'\n\n'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very\nglad to hear it.'\n\n'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?'\n\n'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.\n\n'You wish to be anonymous?'\n\n'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.'\n\n'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'\n\n'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'\n\n'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.\n\n'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
